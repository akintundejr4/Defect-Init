# Defect-Init
An application for creating the items neccesary for "intializing" or starting up work on a software defect, as defined by my position at time of creation. It makes a folder with the defect's name, and then an informational markdown file pre populated with data from Excel (if chosen) that has information relevant to working the defect.

## How It Was Made 
Created as a C# console application.
