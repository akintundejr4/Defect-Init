# Defect-Init
A C# console application for creating the folder and applicable informational markdown file for starting work on a software defect, specific to my position at time of creation. 

## How It Was Made 
The tool was created as a C# console application. 

## Why It Was Made 
So I wouldn't have to manually create  a new folder and file with the proper document structure every time I was assigned a defect to work on.
